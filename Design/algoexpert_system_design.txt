AlgoExpert System Design Fundamentals


3. Client Server Model: 

        Lets look at an example
        
        Client: browser 
            - DNS: 
                - IP

        
        Server: AlgoExpert backend

        Client: A machine or process that requests data or service from a server

        Node: a single machine can be both the client and a server at the same times

        IP address: an address given to each machine connected the public internet. IPV4 address consists of four numbers seperated by dots.  where all 4 values are from 0 - 255

        In order for multiple programs to listen for a new network connection without colliding, they pick a port:
            here are some predefined example ports:
                22: Secure Shell
                53: DNS lookup
                80: http
                443: HTTPS 


4. Network protocols: 
    IP: Internet Protocol address
        - IP packet: data sent from one machine to another
        - IP address: a unique address given to each machine connected to the public internet
        - IP packets: are made up of bytes

    TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
        - built on top of the IP
        - send IP packets in an ordered way
        - allows you to send arbitrarily large pieces of data

    HTTP: 
        - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
        - Built on top of TCP
        - introduces higher level of abstraction on top of TCP and IP
        - basically a way of communicating in a request and response paradigm
        - HTTP is a request/response protocol that is much more applicable in sys design questions.
