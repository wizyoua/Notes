2. Components of a system
    - logical entities
        - data (databases)
        - programs (applications) logical entity that gives access to these systems
            - programs and db's talk through communication protocols like: 
                - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
                - HTTP( Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
                - IP (Internet Protocol)

            - presentation layers are like websites and apps (this is optional depending on the system)
        - users(CRUD operations to DB's) they use applications

    - Tangible entities:
        - text
        - db's 
        - api's 
        - backend languages like java, go , python
        - caching: Redis
        - cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, Azure

3. Client Server architecture
    - client: 
        - thick vs thin client: 
            - thick client: has a lot of logic, has a lot of code, has a lot of data on the front-end (gaming, video editing, ric gui)
            - thin client: has majority of processing on the backend (e commerce, streaming)
    - client request for data from server, server responds with data

    2 tier : logic or data sit on client or server (light weight for small business)

    3 tier: data is heavy so client hits application and that application hits a data application. (bigger apps like management, bigger e commerce)

    n Tier(gmail, facebook)

4. Proxies 
    - Proxy: (on behalf), 
    - Forward proxy:
        machine that sits between client and server. Client sends req to proxy, then proxy to server. (client never speaks with server)
        - useful for disguising identity, traffic is controlled and monitored, blocking access to certain sites.
        - 
    - Reverse Proxy:
        - sits on the server side, takes in request from clients and forwards it to the server. (client never speaks with server)
        - traffic control, load balancing, caching response from server , mitigate ddos attacks

    - if reverse proxy fails it becomes a bottleneck, a forward proxy is using them to access the internet even if your country blocks certain sites.

5. Data, Data storage and data flow
