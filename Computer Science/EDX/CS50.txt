	- Computer stores binaries to powers of 2
	- bit is a binary digit 
	- computer can represent any number of values all it needs is bits
	- How does a computer represent a letter, computers only have electricity in them. 
	- a pattern of bits = whatever letter we want to map. So 65 bits = A
	- ASCI = 
	- a byte is just 8 bits, a sequense of 8, 0's and 1's together

	A = 65
	B = 66
	C = 67 
	D = 68


	Abstraction - used in comp sci takes low level implementation and adding another level on it to solve problems. 
	- take low level detail and simplifying it. 


	ASCI  = 8 bits which = 255 variations, which is why a keyboard
	UNICODE = allows to use soo much bits which is qhy emojis is possible instead of just a normal keyboard
	RGB = represent a pixel we will use 3 bytes, one is red, green, blue. you combine to get different colors - 0 - 255 rgb optioned in r,g,b

	now we go into video
	Video is just built up on FPS, they are just really fast images.


	INPUT -> [] - > OUTPUT

	whats inside [] = algorithms

	y axis is time to solve , x is size of problem

	first algo going through each page to find name in phone book is a line close to straight up
	second algo is half as many steps
	third algo which goes half on phone book then starts to half until reach is log 

	programming is leveraging this intuition is to solve problems with that fast intution. 

	psuedocode is use any spoken language so a computer/robot or person can understand what they say.
