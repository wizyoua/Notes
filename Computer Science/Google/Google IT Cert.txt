ASCII
UTF-8: allows us to represent all characters in Unicode
Unicode: allows us to represent all characters in all languages

color: 0-255 RGB each char is a shade of the color


Binary:
0-1 on(1) or off(0)

loom: holes thread would either go through or not go through just like 0/1 or on/off

translating 0-1, comp can calculate sequences of 0-1s and translate them into other things
now, instead of holes we use electricity to pass through voltage and represent on/off 

Logic Gates: more complex tasks based on transistors.
6 common logic gates:
Not: 1 input and 1 output, flips the input
AND: 2 inputs and 1 output, output is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise 0
OR: 2 inputs and 1 output, output is 1 if either input is 1, otherwise 0, 1 or both inputs are 1
XOR: 2 inputs and 1 output, output is 1 if exactly 1 input is 1, otherwise 0, off if both inputs are 1
NAND: 2 inputs and 1 output, output is 0 if both inputs are 1, otherwise 1
XNOR: 2 inputs and 1 output, output is 0 if exactly 1 input is 1, if both inputs are 1

How to count in binary:
- base 10: 0 - 9 

represent h in binary
h = 104 ascii to decimal table
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
0   1  1   0 1 0 0 0

64+32+8 = 104


Intro to computer hardware:
- ports are connection points for hardware
- Ram: random access memory, stores data and instructions for the CPU to use temporarily
- harddrive: holds data and instructions for long term storage
- Motherboard: everything in place that allows everything to communicate,
- PSU: power supply unit, converts power from wall to power that computer can use
- all of these

Programs: cpu and memory:
- computers speak in machine language, binary. 
- if we want to communicate with machines we need to speak in machine language, they have built in translators
- Programs: are instructions that we give to the computer to execute
- program stores instructions in ram, small instructions at a time
- EDB: The EDB is a row of wires that interconnect the parts of our computer, kind of like the veins in our body. 
- The MCC sends data grabbed from the RAM and sends it to the CPU through the EDB.
- inside cpu registers are used to store data and instructions. 
register a and register b, adding a and b, store result in register c
- memory controller chip: MCC bridge between cap and cpu, 
- address bus: cpu to mcc: tells mcc which memory address to read from
- cpu also has cache, small amount of data that is constantly used, faster than ram
- l1 cache, l2 cache, l3 cache
- cpu has internal clock, connected to clock wire, wire sends voltage to cpu that allows it to do things
- clock cycle: 3.4ghz, max clock cycles per second, 3.4 billion clock cycles per second
- overclocking: increasing clock speed, can cause overheating
- overclocked commonly used in lower end cpus
