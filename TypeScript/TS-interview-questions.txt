1. What are the primitive types in TypeScript?
  - Boolean
  - string

2. Explain how the arrays wor in Typescript? 
- Arrays are generic types in TypeScript. They are defined as a generic type with the name Array. The syntax for defining an array is as follows: 
let values: number[] = [1, 2, 3];

3. what is any type?
- if we don't know what the type will be of a given value we can give a variable the any type. This is useful when we are working with existing JavaScript code that we don't have type information for.

4. What is void? 
- void is a type that is used to indicate that a function does not return a value. exmaple: 
function printMessage(message: string): void {
  console.log(message);
}

5. what is a unknown type?
-  is a type safe counterpart of any type. We can assign anything to a variable of type unknown, but we canâ€™t assign a variable of type unknown to a variable of any other type without first checking to see what the type of the unknown is. We can narrow it down like this:
let foo: unknown = "me";
let bar: string = foo as string;

6. what are the different keywords to declare variables in TypeScript?
- var: declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
- let: declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
- const: declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.

7. make a function the type annotation:
function greet(name: string): string{
    return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
