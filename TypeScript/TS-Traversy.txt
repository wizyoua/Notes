- typescript is a super set.
- using static types is optional but is the recommended way to use typescript. This is because
js is a dynamic language and typescript is a superset of js. So you can use typescript as a
framework for js development. 
- can be used with react and angular, also node js
- supports classes arrow functions
- main reason is to add static types to your js
Static languages:
    - java
    - c++
    - Rust
    - go
    dynamic: 
        - js
        - python 
        - ruby 

Pros:
    - more robust
    - less bugs
    - predictable
    - readable
    - popular
Cons:
    - More code to write
    - more to learn
    - requires compilation (browsers don't read TS files needs to be compiled to js)
    - not true static typing 

- .ts files are compiled to .js files
- .tsx files are compiled to .jsx files
- TSC (typescript compiler) is used to compile ts files to js files
- tsconfig.json is used to configure the compiler
