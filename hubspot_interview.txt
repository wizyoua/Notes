Merge 2 sorted arrays and cut to a certain length:
arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
arr2 = [7,8,9,10,11,12]



JS: 

prototypes: allows us to add properties or methods to any object (Number, Boolean, String, Date)

    function book(title, author){
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
    }


    let myBook = new book('The Hobbit', 'JRR Tolkien');

    //Object.prototype.(property || method)
    book.prototype.price = null;
    myBook.price = 100;

    document.write("Book title is: " + myBook.title + "<br>");
    document.write("Book author is: " + myBook.author + "<br>");
    document.write("Book price is: " + myBook.price + "<br>");

    output:
    Book title is : The Hobbit
    Book author is : JRR Tolkien
    Book price is : 100



Prototypical inheritance: 

call():
apply():
bind():

function Admin(...args){
    //this will run the User function class we have defined above. Notice the rest operator, we are getting unknown number of arguments and converting them to an array.
    User.apply(this, args);
    this.role = 'superadmin';
}

const admin = new Admin('shaun@ninjas.com', 'shaun');


how to use rest parameters in ES6
function(...args) {
  console.log(args);
}
