Vue: 

Vue 2:
Vue 3:
    - using Vite js which has tools such as instant server start, out of box support for typescript, and a lot of other tools.
    - vuex & penia for state management

Major differences: 
    - creating app: 
        - Global configuration make issues during unit tests because test cases can affect each other.
        - vue3 makes it difficult to share a copy of config to multiple apps

        - vue 2 you only implement 1 single root node in the the template but vue3 allows you to have multiple root nodes.
