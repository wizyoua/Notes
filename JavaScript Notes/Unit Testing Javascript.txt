Unit Testing in Javascript - Youtube Course

	- function add(x,y){
		return x+y;
	}

	add(2,3);

	- We've set expectations for how this function is being used, time to add unit testing.

	ok so based on the simpl function what are you expectations:
		- Expect 2 + 3 = 5 
		- Expect error iF non-numbers are used
		- expect 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3

		I would expect all of the expections to be true, but the third one won't work. See how the aswer would be 0.300000 because of floating point


	Lets refactor this function with the above expectations (Red, Green, Refactor ) methos

		function add(x,y){
			var result;
			if((typeof x && typeof y) !== 'number'){
				throw new Error('Params must be a number');
			} 

			result = x + y;
			if parseInt(result) !== result){
				result = parseFloat(result.toFixed(1));
			}

			return result;
		}
