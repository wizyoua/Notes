1. Laguage Fundamentals
    - difference between null and undefined
        - undefined: before any value is assigned to a variable the variable contains undefined, it is also a data type
        - null: means nothing, both undefined andnull mean nothingness but they both are different data types, so undefined == null is true 
          but undefined === null is false

        - you can assign a variable to undefined
    
    - function scope vs block scope
        - es5 has function scope because of hoisting and es6 has block scope
            - var keyword is hoisted but let and const are hoisted to their block
        - es6 has block scope
            - let and const are hoisted to their block

    - Automatic semicolon insertion
        - javascript automatically inserts semicolons at the end of a line if it is missing.

    - Rest vs Spread
        - rest: used to pass an indefinite number of arguments to a function
        - spread: used to split up array elements or object properties
