	Lesson 27
		- Code goes to JS Engine (Parser -> Abstract Syntax tree. Conversion to machine code - > code runs)

	Lesson 28 
		- All js code needs to run in execution context. The global execution contect (code that is not inside of any function is gloabal, Assosiated with global object, in the browser this is the window object).

		- Each time we call a function it gets its own execution context. 
	Lesson 29
	- Execution Context in Detail
		1. Creation Phase
			- Creating of the variable object
			- creation of the scope chain
			- determine value of this
		2. Exection Phase
			- The code of the function that generated the current execution context is ran line by line. 

		//code example - Hoisting, in the creation phase of the execution function the function is stored in a var. 

			calculateAge(1990);

			function calculateAge(year){
				console.log(2016 - year);
			}

			var retirement = function(year){
				console.log(65 - (2016 - year));
			}
