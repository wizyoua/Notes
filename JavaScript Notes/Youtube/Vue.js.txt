VueJS - Youtube - The Net Ninja

	What is Vue
		- Front end framework
		- create js web apps
		- runs in browser
		- no multipe server requests for pages

		- very lean
		- very high run time perfomance


	Vue instance

	Data and methods
		- could put methods within the vue instance after the data key prop. Can access data keys with this.name for exmaple

	data binding
		- use v-bind:href="google.com" for example
		- vue js will data bind 
		- we could bind to input 

	Events
		- basically just like jquery events like clickevent onclick. Theres a whole list on vuejs docs. 
		- bind like this: <button v-on:event> </button>

	Event-modifiers
		- <button v-on:event.once> </button>

	Keyboard Events
		- could add on keyboard modifiers say you want to fire something when enter is clicked. see vuejs keyboard events list for more options.

	2 way Data Binding
		- just like angular, value gets inputted into div with 2 way databinding

	Computer Properties
		- Vuejs does not know which method needs to run based on what has been updated. Computed property solves that issue, they watch vars that need to be computed and only run when needed.
		- ex. update A and Age + A when you click button to add 1 it only adds to A since in syntax we run {{addtoA}} instead of the method {{addtoA()}}
	
	Dynamic CSS Classes
		- mostly coding section, no notes

	Conditionals

	- skipped not taking on 5-6 sections because most of it was coding to learn.

	Intro to Components
		- a reusable piece of code we can reuse in different vue instances.
		- in component, data has to be a function it's not the same as a simple vue instance

	Vue Lifecycle hook
	- When Vue() instance
		- beforeCreate: could put stuff in and run code before vue runs
	- Observe Data
	- Initialize Events
		- created: when component has been created.

	- has 'el' option, it's that part in new Vuew({ el: '#app'})
	- Compile template
		- beforeMount: anything we need to do before mount we could use this
	- Mount
		- Mount: could reach in a manipulate the dom here
	- Mounted
		- beforeUPdate: could fire could before it updates
		- updated: access updated code 
		-beforeDestory: pop in could here before it's destroyed
	- Teardown
		- destroyed: could run stuff here once it's destroyed

	- Slots
		- you could pass templates in betweend custom component in parent to  child using <slot></slot>
		- example where slots is beneficial. A website with a bunch of form, allow front end developer to create forms on existing templates,
