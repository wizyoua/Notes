	Data and methods

	data brinding
		- use v-bind:href="google.com" for example
		- vue js will data bind 
		- we could bind to input 

	Events
		- basically just like jquery events like clickevent onclick. Theres a whole list on vuejs docs. 
		- bind like this: <button v-on:event> </button>

	Event-modifiers

	Computer Properties
		- Vuejs does not know which method needs to run based on what has been updated. Computed property solves that issue
		- ex. update A and Age + A when you click button to add 1 it only adds to A since in syntax we run {{addtoA}} instead of the method {{addtoA()}}
