	const fetch = require('node-fetch')

	async fuction fetchAvatarUrl(userid){
		
		//this would be the actual result not a promise
		const response = await fetch('https;//catapi.com/users/${userId}')
		const data = await response.json()
		
		//without await its a promise, with await its now actual data
		data
		//will return the actual value, great example of refactoring promises
		return data.imageUrl

	}

	const response result = fetchAvatarUrl(123)
	result


//Inside a function marked as async, you are allowed to place the await keyword in front of an expression that returns a promise. WHen you do, the execution of the async function is paused until the promise is resolved

	Why asynce/await?
	- write aync code that flows like sync code
	- only 1 at a time not multiple promises
