es6 JS tutorial for Beginners - Youtube - Academind

	- Compiler for es6 until all browsers support es6 (babel)
	- Module loader (webpack) for pure module loader

	Syntax Changes and Extensions
		- let and const 
		- they allow us the way we work with variables
		- let allows us to use block scoping within the scope where it is defined
			if (true) {
			  let name = "max"
			}
		- that variable name wont be available outside of the if scope
		- const is defined once and should keep its value. Common practice is all caps const name
		- we have to declare variable before initializing it, this refers to hoisting. a function will still get hoisted to the top

	Fat Arrow Function - shorter way to write function and has another feature

		- Parentheses is arguments and inside body is executing code.
		var fn = () => {
		  console.log("hello");
		}
		  
		fn();
		
		- if you have one argument you could leave out parentheses, 2 or 0 arguments need parenthesis. same for block of function, if its one line you could remove curly braces since only one line

		- this is treated is handled differently. with fat arrow function it will keep context in which the object is defined.

	Functions
	 	- could give arguments a default value


	 Object Literal Expressions
	 	- what is object literal
	 		let = {
	 			name : "max",
	 			age:27
	 		};

	 	- es6 ol

	 	you can define methods and function now

	 	let name = 'anna';
	 	let age = 25;
	 	let obj = {
			name,
			age,
			greet(){
			
			}	 	
	 	};

	 	console.log(obj);
