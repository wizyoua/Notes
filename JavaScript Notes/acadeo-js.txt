1.  var vs let vs const
    - var is not scope-safe. It  can unexpectedly change the value of a variable.
    - let & const is scope-safe, you will not be able to access the var outside of the scope. Var will  get hoisted to the top of the scope.

2.  The "This"  keyword
        - "this" is a keyword that refers to the object that is executing the current function.
