1. JS in the backend : Javascript is a synchrounous single-threaded language

(variable
enviroment)
Memory       |        Code 
key:value    |        thread of execution
fn: {}


2. What happens when you run js Code

drawiofile.
Call stack manages execution content in JS. EC has memory and code execution. Thats it
Call stack maintains the order of execution context:


3. Hoisting in JS
    - Functions are hoisted but not variables
    - functions and variables are stored in memory before execution so logging a variable before it is assigned will be undefined instead of error not found.
    

4. Functions: Understand execution context and call stack with the code below:

    var x = 1;
    a();
    b();
    console.log(x);

    function a(){
        var x = 10;
        console.log(x);
    }

    function b(){
        var x = 100;
        console.log(x);
    }
