Javascript Refresher

Variables:

    Let - use let if variable is going to be reassigned
    Const - use const if variable is not going to be reassigned


Arrow Functions:
    normal function 
    function myFunc(){...}

    arrow:
    const myFunc = () => {...}


Exports & Imports (modules):

    person.js
    const person = {
        name: "max"
    }

    export default person

    "default" means that in the import file we can name the variable whatever we want because no matter what we defaulted to export the import will bring that in. 

    app.js
    import person from './person.js'
