Steps to approach system design problems in interviews:
1. Understand the problem and establish design scope : 5 min
    - what are the requirements
    - who are the users
    - what are the constraints
    - propose top features to build
    - non functional requirements: Security, Consistency, Availability, Scalability, Performance, etc

2. propose high level design and get buy-in: 20 min
    - start with a top down approach and API
    - follow REST params
    - don't make apis that aren't part of functional requirements

    High level design diagram:
    - Load balancer -> web services -> DB -> Cache 
    - it's good at this stage to design at a high level then keep track of areas to optimize
    - Data model and Schema
3. Design deep dive: 15 min
    - ask questions about the design and answer any optmizations.
    - articulate the tradeoffs

4. Wrap up and Q&A: 5 min
    - spend some minutes summarizing the design and answering questions
