1. Introduction
    - What is React
        - JS library created by FB
        - Used to create JS driven dynamic web apps
    - What is Redux
        - layer on React
        - helps with statemanagement of our apps
            - data in apps
            - UI state of apps

2. How React works
    -  Virtual Dom in background, say we make a change to search box. React creates new dom and compares to old dom.
    - Components look like html but are actually JSX
    - They can contain state
    - They also contain JS for functionality

5. Component state
    - Js Object
    - Describes the current state of the Component
        - data, ui-state
    - State of Component can be updated over time
        - a modal could close
        - the data we output could change

8. Changing State and ('this')
    - this keyword is determined by how and where the function is called not where it sits.
    - new version of react, class component we have to bind concept of this keyword to our functions
    - easiest way is to use arrow methods for our custom functions
    state = {
        name = 'gio',
        age 20
    }

    handleclick = (e) => {
        console.log(this.state);
    }

    so if you want to use this keyword inside our custom functions, just convert them to using arrow method like above
    - Don't change state directly use:
        this.setState({
            name: 'yela'
        });

10. Create React App 
    - CLI to create react apps
    - dev server
    - use es6 features 
    - keep code modular
    - use build tools to optimize code

11. Single Page apps
    - react apps are typically spa
    - only ever one html page served to browser
    - 
12. Nesting component App.js is root component then I could bring say Header component

15. Stateless Component
    - Container component
        - contain state
        - containe lifecycle hooks
        - not concered with UI
        - use classes to create
    - UI Component
        - dont contain state
        - recieve data from props
        - only concered with UI
        - use functions to create

IMPORTANT!! - In Class Based components the props from parent component are passed automatically,
but in a functional components we have to pass props as parameter to the function.
