React Basics
	1. Why React?

		- Declarative - Our program describes the result we are trying to achieve.

		- Component Based - We can design build and test a component once then implement into application.

		- We could write simple code that translates data model into an efficient app

	2. State and Virtual DOM

		- Interactive with the DOM is where performance matters

		- React renders real DOM elements from virtual DOM so speed of application is significantly increased.

	3. Understanding JSX

		- Name of element, the list of attributes, finally then children

		//Takes 3 elements
		React.createElement('a', {
			href: "https://teamtreehouse.com"
		}, "Treehouse");
		J

		- JSX is an alternate syntax for calling functions in JS
		- HTML and JS will be combined. 
	4. PropTypes and DefaultProps
		- .propTypes each key in here a property that our component could take
		- to pass a value you need to change within the render() to title={8} so that it doesn't take a string or break since passing a number with out {} will not compile properly
