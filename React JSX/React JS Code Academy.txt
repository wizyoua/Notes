React JS Code Academy

Part 1

	- What is JSX?

		- JSX is a syntax extension for Javascript. It was written to be used React. JSX code looks a lot like HTML/
		- Syntax extension? JSX is not valid JavaScipt, browser can't read it 
		- if a file contains jSX code then that will have to be compiled. Before it reach a web browser, a JSX compiler will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript. 

	- JSX Elements
		- <h1>Hello world</h1> - is exactly HTML except found in a javascript file. 

	- JSX and their surroundings

		- JSX element can be saved in a variable, passed to a function stored in an object or array.

	- Attributes in JSX
		-JSX elements can have attributes like html can
		- JSX att is written using html like syntax: my-attribute-name="my-att-value"


	- Nested JSX
		- You can nest JSX elements inside of other JSX elements just like in HTML.
		- if a JSX expression takes up more than one line, then you must wrap the multi line JSX expression in parenthesis
		- Nested JSX expressions can be saved as variables, passed to functions. just like non nested expressions can. 

	- JSX outer Elements
		- JSX expression must have only one outermost element. 

	- ReactDOM.render()
		- ReactDome is the name of the JavaScript library. it contains several react specific methods, all of which deal with the DOM some way or another. 
		- ReactDOM.render() is the most common way to render JSX. It takes a JSX expression, creates a corresponding tree of Dom nodes, and adds that tree to the DOM. That is the way to make a JSX expression appear on screen. 
		_ ReactDOM.render makes its first argument appear on screen, but where on the screen should the first argument appear? the first argument is appended to whatever element is selected by the second argument.

	- Passing a variable to ReactDOM.render()
		- ReactDOM.render first argument should evaluate to a JSX expression it doesn't have to literally be the JSX expression
		- The first argument could also be a variable so long it evaluates to a JSX expression

	- The virtual DOM
		- ReactDOM.render() only updates DOM elements that have changed
		- That means if you render the exact same thing twice in a row, the second render will do nothing. 
		- ONly updated the necessary ODM elements is a large part of what makes React so successful. React accomplishes this due to virtual DOM

	- class vs className
		- in JSX, instead of class we use className. because class is reserved in JS so can't use in JSX

	- Self-Closing Tags
		- in JSX you have to remember to close the html so if you use html elements that don't have closing tags like <br> you have to use backslash <br />

	- JavaScript in your jsx in your JS
		- any code between tags in JSX will be interpreted as HTML. {} curly braces will be used to input JS in between 
		- <h1>{2+3}</h1> will actually be 5 since the brackets allow JSX to read it as normal JS

	- Variables in JSX
		- when you inject JS into JSX, its part of the same environment, we can access vars while inside of a JSX expression, even if they were declared outside. 

	- Variable attributes in JSX
		- it's common to use variables to set attributes

	- Event Listeners in JSX
		- JSX elements can have event listeners, just like HTML can. Programming in react will mean that we are constantly working with event listeners. Create an event listener by giving a JSX element a special attribute
		- event listeners attribute value should be a function
		- JSX event listeners camel case
