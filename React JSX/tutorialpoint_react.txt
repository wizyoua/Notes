1. what is React?
   - React is a library for building user interfaces. 
   - supports server-side rendering.
   - used virtual DOM instead of real DOM.
   - component based architecture. They are indepedent and reusable.

   Limitations: 
   - React is not a full blown framework. It is a library.
   - makes use of inline templating

4. What is useState?
    - useState is a built-in hook that is used to update the state of a component.
    - it should be used when the DOM has something that is dynamically manipulating/controlling.

    - What is a lambda function?
    - A lambda expression are abstractions which enable a function to be passed around like data

    - what is a tuple?
    - A tuple is a collection of values.
    

    - use state first parameter is the state variable.
    - use state second parameter is the function that updates the state variable.

5. what are keys in react?
    - special string attribut that needs to be included when using lists of elements
    - keys help identify which element is being updated.

6. What is JSX?
    - JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript.
    - it allow us to write HTML like syntax in JavaScript.

7. What are the differences between functional and class based components
    - first what are hooks? 
    - hooks are functions that let you hook into  React state and lifecycle features from function components

    - Effect Hook?
        - useEffect is a hook that lets you perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate 
        but it is just unified into a single API

    - functional components  were called stateless component and were behind class components on a feature basis. But after the introduction of Hooks, 
        functional components became the default.

    - function component example:
        const MyComponent = () => {
            //example of react hook
            const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
            return (
                <div>
                    <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
                    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
                        Click me
                    </button>
                </div>
            );
        }

    - we cannot use react hooks inside class components


8. What is virtual DOM? how dos react use it to render the UI
    - virtual DOM is a concept where a virtual represenation of the real DOM is kept inside memory and is synced with the real DOM by a library such as ReactDOM

9. What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components
    - controlled components are is when the value of input elements are controlled by React using event-based callbacks. 
    - uncontrolled component is handled by the DOM itself so that turns it into a traditional method of form submission.

10. What are props in react?
    - they are in the inputs to a component of react. They can be single-valued or objects 
    - functionality includes:
        - passing data to a component
        - using this.props.reactProp inside render method
        - triggering state changes

11. 




13. prop drilling?
    - props that are passed into deeply nested components but the downfall is that the middle components have access to them

14. 



20. what is strict mode?
    - identifying components with unsafe lifecycle methods
    - warning about the usage of legacy string API
    - warning about usage of findDOMNode



27. React lifecycle:
    - Initialization: sets up default props and initial state
    - mounting: puts elemnts into the browser DOM. Componentwillmount and componentDidMount
    - Updating: updates the component state and re-renders the UI
        - componentWillUpdate and componentDidUpdate
    - Unmounting: removes the component from the browser DOM
        - componentWillUnmount
