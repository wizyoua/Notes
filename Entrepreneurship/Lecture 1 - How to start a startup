 	- Cofounders
 		- Good way to meet cofounders
 			* College or innovative company
 		- Better to have no co founder than a bad co founder
 		- Co founders need to be tough, creative, desive, Calm 
 		- Know your co founders for a while, ideally years
 		- when should cofoudners decide on equity split - Do not leave this off, you need to set this ideally very soon after you start working together
 		-relationship with co founder falls apart - every co founder has ot have vesting. Pre negotiating if somebody leaves. It takes 4 years to earn. Make sure you have vesting equity. Another thing to do is when problems arise is to talk about it early, do not let it simmer. 

 	- Employees
 		- Try not to hire as many people as you can. No need until it is really necessary. Get shit done with the smallest team you can
 		- Cost of getting early hire on is high. Somebody can cause huge damage if they aren't a fit 
 		- You need people to believe into it as much as you do
 		- To get the very best people you have to convince them of the product you are offering. 
 		- If you are going to join a company join something that is going to blow up. 
 		- How much time spent hiring: 0 or 25% hiring
 		- Mediocre engineers do not build great companies
 		- 3 things to look for when hiring people
 			- Are they smart
 			- Do they get things done
 			- Do I want to spend alot of time around them
 		- Good communication skills
 		- Manically determined
 		- Pass the animal test - describe any employee as an animal in what they do
 		- Would feel comfortable reporting to them
 		- Employee equity - 10% to first 10 employees- over 4 years if they are successfull they will benefit. Founders are generally generous to investors instead of employees which isn't ideal because employees offer greater benfit over time than investors
 		- Employees should feel Happy and feel value
 		- Praise your team for making the good stuff
 		- Be aware that as a first time founder you will most likely be a bad manager
 		- If you need to fire somebody do it fast. One of the worst parts of starting a company 
 		- Fire people who create office politics or a drag to be around
 		- Anybody will screw up once or twice but if somebody is getting every decision wrong they gotta go
 		- Inexperience is ok but how do you know if somebody will grow. People who are smart can find a role in the company
