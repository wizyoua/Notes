Angular helps:
 1. organize your JavaScript
 2. create responsive websites
 3. plays well with jQuery
 4. easy to test

Directives: Marker on HTML tag that tells Angular to run or reference some JavaScript code.


Modules:
	1. Where we write pieces of our Angular application.
	2. Makes our code more maintainable, testable and readable.
	3. Where we define dependencies for our app.
		- modules can use the same module

Expressions: 
	- Allow you to insert dynamic values into your HTML

Controllers: where we define our app's behavior by defining functions and values.
	- wrapping your JS in a closure is good habit!
	- Controller is attached to (inside) our app.

Built in Directives:
	1. 
	2. ng-hide/ ng-show: display a section base on an Expression.
	3. ng-repeat: repeat a section for each item in an Array
	4. ng-app: attach the apps module to the page
	5. ng-controller: attach a controller function to the page.


What we have learned so far:
	1. Directives - HTML annotations that trigger JavaScript behaviors 
	2. Modules - Where our application components live
	3. Controllers - Where we add application behavior
	4. Expressions - How values get displayed within the page
