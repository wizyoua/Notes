Week 1
	
	Types: 
		int - represent integers
		float - represent real numbers (3.27)
		bool - represents  boolean value true/false
		NoneType - special and has one value, None
		can us Type() to see the type of object
	
	Operators and Branching
		 - i and j are any variable of numbers
		 - i > j
		 - i >= j
		 - i < j
		 - i <= j
		 - i == j - equal
		 - i != j - not equal

		 - and b are any var names
		 - not a - true if a is false, false if a is true


		 Branching programs
		 - the simplest branching statement is a conditional
		  - A test 
		  - a block of code to execute test
		  - an optional block of code to execute if the test is false
		  - in python we don't have to have the false block


		 Compound Boolean
		 	- if x < y and x < z:
		 		print ('x is least')
		 	elif y < z :
		 		print ('true')
		 	else: 
		 		print ('true')

	Bindings
		- 
	Strings
		- letters, special chars, spaces, digits
		- enclosed in quotation marks
		- concat strings
