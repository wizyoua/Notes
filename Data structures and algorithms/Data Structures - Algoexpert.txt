Data Structures Algoexpert

1. What are Data Structures:
    - manipulate data involves structuring data and managing data
    - is a collection of data values, relationships among them, the functions that can be applied to the data.


2. Complexity Analysis:
    - better undertstanding DS with it, it is the bedrock of coding interview problems
    - Coding problems can have multiple solutions, we try to figure out the best complexity Analysis
    - solutions are all different, some solutions are better than other.
    - Time complexity: (high level overview) measure of how fast and algo runs
    - Space complexity:  measure of how much memory/space an algo uses up
    - different DS will have different Time and Space Complexity

3. Memory:
    - memory analogy: a canvas where we have a litte slots like a table with squares that are numbered, pretend each number is a memory slots
    - 1 Memory slot can hold 8 bits = 1 Byte
    - 
    - Bit: short for binary digit, a bit is a fundamental unit of information in Comp Sci that represents a state with one of two values, typically 0 and 1
    - Byte: 
4. Big O Notation:
    - Time Complexity : the measure of an algo speed as the size of the input increases.
    - It's impossible to describe the time complexity in milliseconds that is why we measure in a different way 
    - We see why we test time complexity with the size of the input, because some algos can run fast as you increase size but others will obviously take forever
    - O(1) constant:  means that as size of input increases, time stays constant
    - O(n) : size of input(n) increases, the speed of the algo increase linearly
    - O(n^2) : 

    - Big O notation you should read it as asymptotic measure of our algo
    - accessing a value to a direct memory slot would take constant time
    - in Order:
        1. O(1)
        2. O(log(n))
        3. O(N)
        4. O(N log(n))
        5. O(n^2)
        6. O(2^n)
        7. O(N!)

    - Big O notation refers to time or space complexity in the worst case scenario


5. Logarithm: 
    - mathematical concept widely used in comp sci and that's defined by the following equation:
    logb(x) = y if and only if b^y = x 
    - log(n) is a great complexity compared to O(n) since the more data, the n only increases just a little Bit
    instead of increasing a lot linearly
