- What is is a sorting algorithm
    - A function used to rearrange a given array or list of elements
    according to a comparison operator on the elements.
    - Data
        - collection of info stored ina similar location such ass array
        - will always be in the form of

    - 2 states data can be
        1. sorted: data is sorted by some order
        2. unsorted: data is not in any particular order


- Why do we need to sort lists:
    - having a sorted list allows you to gain a lot more from the data that you would otherwise

    - Unsorted data: linear search method
    - Sorted data: Binary search (much more efficient)

1. Comparison sorts:
    - sort a set of data by continually comparing the elements near each other in the list, and swapping if necessary.
        1. selection sort
        2. odd-even sort
        3. bubble sort
        4. cocktail-shaker sort
        5. quicksort
        6. Bitonic sort
        7. Heap sort
        8. Cycle sort

2. Insertion Sorts:
    - go through list of elements and slowly build the sorted list one element at a time.
        1. Insertion sort
        2. Shell sort

3. Merge sort: recursive sorting algo
4. Bucket sort: counting sort
5. Comb sort: exchange sort
