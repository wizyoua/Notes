Recognizing where to apply this Algorithmic mental model

    - things we iterate sequentially
        - continuous sequence of elements
        - strings, arrays, linked list
    - min, max, longest, shortest, contained
        - maybe we need to calculate something

Question Variants:

1. Fixed Length 
    - max sum subarray of size k 
    - 
2. Dynamic Variant 
    - smallest sum >= to some value S

3. Dynamic Variant with Auxillary Data Structure: means introducing hashmap, array, ect. 
    - longest substring with k distinct characters




Find max sum subarray of a fixed size k

public function findMaxSubarray(arr, k){
    maxValue = Integer.Min_Value;
    let currentRunningSum = 0;

    for(let i = 0; i< arr.length; i++) {
        
    }
}
