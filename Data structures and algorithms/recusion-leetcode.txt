Recursion Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/recursion-i/

- Recursion is an approach to solving problems using a function that calls itself as a subroutine
    - everytime you call the function, it reduces the the given  problem  into subproblems

    Necessary to have in order to avoid infinite loop
        1. base case - terminating sceneries that do not use recusion to produce answer
        2. set of rules (recurrece relation) that reduces all other cases towards the base case.
