Leetcode Learning - Goes by name of Data Structure then overview then content. that is my study method for this site.

Binary Tree 

	Overview: 

		- A tree is a frequently used data structure to stimulate a tree structure
		- Each node of the tree has a root value and a list of references to other nodes which are called child nodes. 
		- A BINARY TREE is one of the most typical tree strucurres. it is a data structure in which each node has at most 2 children which are refferend to left and right child.



	Traverse a Tree

	- Pre order Traversal is to visit the root first. then traverse left subtree then right subtree. 

		 A
	    / \
	    B  C
	   /\  /\
       A B C D

       So from start point A it will go to B then A then B then back up then to C and so on.


    - In-Order Traversal 
    
    Time complexity : O(n); n is the number of nodes in a tree


    QUESTIONS:

    1. https://github.com/loatheb/leetcode-javascript/blob/master/144-binary-tree-preorder-traversal/binary-tree-preorder-traversal.js

		    var preorderTraversal = function(root) {
			    const result = [];
			      const stack = [];
			      let node = root;

			      while (node) {
			        node.val && result.push(node.val);  
			        node.right && stack.push(node.right);      
			        node = node.left || stack.pop(); 
			      }

			      return result;
			};
