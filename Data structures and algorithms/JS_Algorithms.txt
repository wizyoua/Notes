Algorithms
    - An algorithm is a sequence of steps to solve a clearly defined problem
    - What is the "best possible  solution?"
        - depends on circumstances but often it would be best performance

    - Measuring Performance:
        - Time Complexity/Big O of an algorithm

    - Big O Notation:
        - O(1)
        - O(log n)
        - O(n)
        - O(n^2)
        - O(n^3)
