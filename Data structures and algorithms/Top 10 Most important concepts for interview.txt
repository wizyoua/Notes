Top 10 Most important concepts for coding interviews
1. Logarithm 
2. Graph Traversal (Depth First search Breadth first search)
3. Binary Search (way better than linear)
4. Sliding Window Technique (manipulate 2 pointers, left pointer right pointer moving simultaniously)
5. Recursion
6. Inverting a Binary tree, reversing a linked list
7. Suffix Trees (advanced DS)
8. Heaps 
9. Dynamic programming
10. Sorting Algorithms - quick sort and merge sort


4 Common Mistakes make in coding interviews
- Over-communicating
- Listing out a bunch of DS, algo, without explaining why they could solve it
- Not buying algo/expert jumping out to the coding without any thought about how  they are going to code
- Not confirming with the interviewer what the problem statement is.
