PHP OOP

Inheritance:
	- when a class is defined by inheriting existing function of a parent class then it is called inheritance. Here child class will inherit all or few member functions and variables of a parent class.

Public access:
	- can access from outside the class in which it is declared
Private access:
	- access within the class in which it is declared
	- can be accessed when extends is used by another class
Protected:
	- access within another class that implements the class in which it is declared
	- accessible in the class in which it is declared, as well as in classes that extend that class.

Class:
	- Programmer defined data type, includes local functions as well as local data. Think of a class as a template for making many instances of the same kind of object
Object:
	- individual instance of the data structure defined by a class. You define a class once  and then make many objects that belong to it. Objects are also known as instance.

Why use OOP:
	- Better organization, each class can be kept in its own separate file.
	- easier maintenance
