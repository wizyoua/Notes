Traditional programming 
- rules + data = answers

Machine learning:
- Answers + data = rules


Phases of machine learning:
- Training Phases
    - this is where we create a model that can predict the output

- Inferencing Phases
    - this is where we use the model to predict the output

- Convulutions are used to extract features from the input data

- Compression is achieved through pooling:
