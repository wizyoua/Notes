Shaun Powers Linux:

1. Where does linux live?
    PC's: desktop, server, laptop
    Embedded devices: phones, cars, refrigerators, etc.
    Cloud: underneath instances, services mostly run on linux

    Linux Kernal: 
        - Debian Based: Ubuntu, Ubuntu Variants, when you install a package it will be a .deb file
        - Red Hat Based: Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, when you install a package it will be a .rpm file
        - Archlinux, slackware, suse, andriod are all built on top of the linux kernal
        - raspbian, runs on raspberry pi and is arm based, compiled for arm processors
        - chrome os, are just OS that is not much more than a browser, but it is built on top of linux

    

2. What applications work in linux
    - Software Boutique: a software store for linux, contains programs alternatives to windows/Commercial programs
    - Apache, NGINX, MariaDB, can all run on linux machines.
    - installed apache using APT, which is a package manager for debian based linux distros
    - redhat uses rpm, they use yum to install packages
    

4. Open Source:
    - FSF: Free Software Foundation
        - original, GNU General Public License (GPL)
    - OSI: Open Source Initiative
        - more business friendly,
        - allows more licenses

    Permissive: MIT, Apache, BSD very lax licenses
    Copyleft: GPL, AGPL, LGPL, more restrictive licenses

    Non-software:
        - photos, music, videos -> creative commons -> attribution, non commercial, no modifying
    
    - There are a variety of licenses and you can get free software but if the content is paid or infra is huge then there's really no
      way to get around paying for it in some way shape or form

5. Doing things with linux
    - almost all servers, or cloud computers use linux
    - passwd: change password

6. master simple cli tools
    - ls -a: list all files including hidden files
    - ls -l: list all files in long format
    - ls -R: list all files recursively
    - rm filename: remove file
    - touch filename: create file
    - rm -rf foldername: remove folders with files in them
    - rm dir
    - cp file1 file2: copy file1 to file2
    - mv file1 file2: renames file1 to file2
    - mv file1 dir1: moves file1 to dir1
    - cp -R dir1 dir2: copy dir1 to dir2, recursively copies everything

    globbing: wildcards

7. You need to know the linux CLI
    - when you open terminal, Bash is the default shell, born again shell
