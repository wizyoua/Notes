- What is a DB?
    a db is organized collection of data stored ans retrieved locally or remotely

- DBMS?
    - Database Management System is responsible for CRUD Management of DB

- RDBMS vs DBMS?
    Relational Database Management System : stores data in the form of a collection of tables and relations can be defined between common fields. Most modern systems are MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and Amazon Redshift

- What is SQL
    - Structured Query Language and is the standard for RDBMS. useful because of Relational ease

- SQL vs MySQL
    - SQL is a standard language for RDBMS
    - MySQL is a relartional database management system that is used to manage SQL DB's

- Tables and Fields?
    - tables is an organized collection of data stored in the form of rows and columns just like excel. The columns are organized in vertical rows and they are called fields

- What are constraints in SQL?
    - are used to specify the rules that must be followed when inserting or updating data in a table. You  can do it on the creation or after with ALTER TABLE
        - NOT NULL 
        - Check 
        - DEFAULT 
        - UNIQUE
        - INDEX
        - Primary Key
        - Foreign Key

- What is a primary key?
    - a primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table and a table can only have one primary key but can apply it to multiple fields. It must contain unique data and has an implicit NOT NULL constraint built in.

- What is a unique contraint?
    - a unique constraint is a constraint that ensures that each row in a table has a unique value for a field. Basically the same as primary key

- What is a foreign key?
    - a foreign key is a reference to another table. It is used to link two tables together. It is used to link a field in one table to a field in another table.

- what is a join?
    - a join is a type of SQL query that joins two or more tables together. It is used to combine the data from two or more tables into a single result set.

    - Inner join : retrieves records that have a matching value in both tables involved in the join. widely used
    syntax: 
    SELECT * FROM table_a JOIN table_b
    SELECT * FROM table_a INNER JOIN table_b on a.a = b.b

    - Left Join: retrieves all the records/rows from the lft and the matched records from the right table
    syntax:
    SELECT * FROM table_a A LEFT JOIN table_b B ON A.column_a = B.column_b

    - Right Join: retrieves all the records/rows from the right and the matched records from the left table
    syntax:
    SELECT * FROM table_a A RIGHT JOIN table_b B ON A.column_a = B.column_b

    - Full OUTER JOIN: retrieves all the records/rows from both the left and right tables
    syntax:
    SELECT * FROM table_a A OUTER JOIN table_b B ON A.column_a = B.column_b

- What is a self-join?
    - a self-join is a join that is performed on the same table. It is used to retrieve records that have a matching value in the same table.
    syntax
    SELECT A.emp_id AS "EMP_ID", A.emp_name AS "Employee", B.emp_id AS "Sup_id", B.emp_name AS "Supervisor" FROM employee A, employee B WHERE A.emp_id = B.emp_id

- What is a cross Join?
    - a cross join is a join that is performed on two or more tables. It is used to retrieve records that have a matching value in two or more tables.
    syntax
    SELECT stu.name, sub.subject FROM students AS stu CROSS JOIN subjects AS sub;

    ex:

    Write a SQL statement to CROSS JOIN 'table_1' with 'table_2' and fetch 'col_1' from table_1 & 'col_2' from table_2 respectively. Do not use alias:
    SELECT table_1.col_1, table_2.col_2 FROM table_1 CROSS JOIN table_2;

    Write a SQL statement to perform SELF JOIN for 'Table_X' with alias 'Table_1' and 'Table_2', on columns 'Col_1' and 'Col_2' respectively.
    SELECT * FROM Table_x AS Table_1, TABLE_X AS Table_2 WHERE Table_1.COL_1 = Table_2.Col_2;

- What is an index? explain its different types
    - a index is a data structure that is used to speed up the retrieval of data from a table.
