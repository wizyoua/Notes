Problem solving for devs: 
1. context ( undertand the problem) - issue - why do i care? ( why is this important to solve)

2. research and refine the problem:
    - starting point search ( google, stackoverflow, github, etc)
    - research ( read docs, read blogs, read books, read code, etc)
    - break down big problems into smaller problems
3. psuedocode ( write out the steps to solve the problem)
4. Test Driven Development ( write tests for the problem)
5. implement the solution
6. reflect on the solution ( what went well, what could be improved, what did i learn)



5 r's of help desk: 
1. reboot
2. reinstall
3. replug/resetting
4. reimage
5. replace

How to troubleshoot any issue: 

5 step framework: (keep, adding, valuable, brave, goals)
1. K - Know your basics(incredibly basic knowledge)
2. A - Ask questions
3. V - visualize the problem
4. B - Break it to replicate it
5. G - google the issue

1st problem
- user getting "site cannot be reached" while accessing your website

1. what is the user doing? (he's trying to access the website)
2. he's getting it all he time or just sometimes? - what kind of error are you getting? are there other areas? (he is getting Err_connection_refused) - is this happening on all browsers? (all broswer) - just for him or all co workers?(everyone) - Interna or access? (internal)
3. url: https://portal.com/home
    lets visualize the problem
    user -> computer -> url goes to load balancer ->load balancer routes to web server node - > nodes pass request to app server -> app server has db app in the end 

    - try to remove app server layer and see if it works
    - check to see if we can eve hit our web server
    - try https://ipaddress:8080


Networking Basics 2023
- LAN
    - IP: an address that is assigned to a device on a network
    - switch : helps to connect multiple devices to the network
    - Router: network device that forwards data packets between networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet.
    - subnet: subnet defined your local area network range
        lets say a user with laptop and cell phone
         ip fo both are 192.168.10.20 and 192.168.1.2  well the subnet would be 255.255.0.0
    - Network Gateway: is the ip address of the router

after these local LAN concepts we move to the bigger picture of router and how it works

- Router
    - NAT: Network Address Translation : is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.
    - Firewall: a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. So lets say an external ip wanted to speak directly to my laptop ip. Well the firewall would block that request. What are the options we have:
        - configure a dmz of port forwarding
    
    - WAN : Wide Area Network
    - DMZ:  is a subnetwork that contains and exposes a device to an untrusted network such as the internet. 
    - Port Forwarding: you dont create a dmz but you forward a port to a specific ip address. So lets say you have a web server on your local network and you want to expose it to the internet. You would forward port 80 to the ip address of your web server. So when a request comes in on port 80 it will be forwarded to your web server.
